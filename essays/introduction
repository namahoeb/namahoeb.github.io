Aloha Everyone,
My name in Brandy! I am a student at the Shidler College of Business at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently majoring in Accounting, however, after this semester, I hope to change my major to Accounting, Finance, and Management Information Systems. This semeter I will be taking ITM 352 as my first course into the ITM degree, as I am sure many of you all are doing the same.
Outside of school, I like to work, trade stocks and options, read, and drink A LOT of boba. I also like going to the beach to watch the sunrise, but Covid-19 is keeping me from doing that right now.
I am a very curious person, and I don't mind putting in the extra time and work to play around and learn new languages of coding. I have only taken beginners ICS courses throughout my yeaes of college and hope that I will be able to use some skills that I learned in those courses, and implement them into this course.
I look forward to meeting you all in the upcoming semester!
