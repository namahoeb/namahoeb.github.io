Aloha Everyone!

My name in Brandy and I am a sophomore at the Shidler College of Business at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently majoring in Accounting; however, after this semester, I hope to change my major to Accounting, Finance, and Management Information Systems. With a triple major in mind, I don't expect to graduate until Fall 2023, but I will still be pushing to take all my classes on time and graduate on time as well. I decided to take this ITM 352 course because I one day want to start my own business, and I know with technology changing every second, I should be able to adapt and familiarize myself with computers, websites, and programming overall.

This ITM 352 course will be my first step into my MIS degree, and I hope that this course, and the many ITM courses to come will help me achieve my goal of starting my own business. I would love to create and personalize my own website without having to pay someone else to do the job for me.

I'm excited to be working with you all and learning more about computer programming languages.
