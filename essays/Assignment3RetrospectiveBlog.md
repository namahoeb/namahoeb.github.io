About the project:

1) What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?

I actually accomplished less than I had planned. In the very beginning I had planned to create this amazing website that allowed users to purchase products and look at their invoice and register and log in to the site to look at their cart again, however, the site did not work as expected. I feel like I did not manage my time to my best ability, which led to an incomplete website which did not work exactly like how I had planned and expected it to work. With more time and dedication, I'm sure the project would have worked much better, however, I am not confident with my website and do not feel like I have accomplished as much as I had planned.
 

2) Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

 I ran into many complications throughout this Assignment. I feel like I did not allot enough time towards completing this final project and it shows through my code and website. There were some problems with debugging and testing, along with some unorganized folders. In order to make multiple trials of code to test different sets of code without messing up my already functional website, I did not organize my folders well enough and mixed many of my functioning and non functioning code. I also hoped to implement a cart side navigation bar to show all the products as they are added, however, that did not happen in the time that I had.
 

3) What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?

My biggest project risk was testing code without saving a draft of the website that had worked before. The code is now mixed with some other code that does not work and I ended up with zombie code and double code. Another risk was time management. I genuinely felt like I would have enough time to complete the project, however, I ended up not having as much time as I thought I did and did not produce the quality work I had expected from myself.
 

4) What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?

I do not feel like this is the best work I could have produced in terms of quality. I definitely feel liek there are parts of my website that could have been adjusted for the better and I feel like I could have put in more time and effort into this project. There are some parts in my website that works and there are some parts of my website that did not work at all. I had toruble finding the bugs and developing the code for data validation on my server. Therefore, there are many flaws in my system.
 

5) What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?

There are many bugs that needs to be fixed before this website can be placed into operation. The login and registration page work on their own, but when trying to implement them into my website to show up when clicking on the purchase button, the login or registration page do not show up. The invoice also does not show up on my Assignment 1 page anymore, meaning that I have issues on the server that needs to be fixed still. I also need to fix the POST vs GET issue on my server to prevent the usernames and passwords from appearing on the query string.
 

6) Describe what you are most proud of about this project:

Although incomplete, I am happy with the appearance of my website and that there are still some functions within my webstie that work, including the data validation for the quanitity and the navigation bar. Ther server is the most difficult part in my opinion, so I am still in the process of making edits to my server file, however, I am proud of how far the server page has gone and I am proud of my understanding in this class. Although I still struggle, I have learned a lot from this class in terms of html, css, and js files. I am happy with what is compelte so far.
 

7) Describe what you are least happy with this project:

I am least happy with the fact that some of pages do not work. I need to look deeper into my code before making any finalized submissions, but the login and registration page still do not function. I am having trouble with security and sending an email to the user when registering to the page, so I am still frustrated that this page would not appear when clicking the purchase button. I am also unhappy with the invoice page that no longer appears when clicking the purchase button. I stuggled alot with the server side process, and this prevented me from getting past to Assignment 3.
 

8) Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. "I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization"):

I worked on this entire project on my own. This was 100% my work and my own code.
