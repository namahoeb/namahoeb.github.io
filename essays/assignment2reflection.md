Aloha Everyone!

1) Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details

In this essay, I will discuss my progress in the Assignments and what I learned from Assignment 2. You can find the link to Assignment 2 and more about the Assignment in the link https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2/. In this assignment we had to edit our Assignment 1 Website to allow new users to register an account and allow regular users to log in using their previously registered accounts. One of the biggest challenges is to prevent other users from overwriting used usernames and emails and allowing users to register to login to their account later. After logging in successfully, they can see their invoice.


2) What did you learn from this assignment?

I learned that there is more than one route you can take when coding. There is no specific set of code that you need to take and you can use a variety of different option sin order to make your code work. I learned a lot more about servers during this Assignment and the last Assignment. I learned not to give up and to keep pushing through. When learning and coding get's difficult, its important to keep on working towards your goal and not give up because if your'e struggling, it means you are definitely learning something!


3) Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

I did not work with a partner for this Assignment


4) How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

When I needed help, I texted my friend who is also taking ITM 352 with me to ask him to look at my code. I needed a second pair of eyes for the most part. After staring at my own code for so long, I tend to miss the technical important parts of my code and this makes it diffcult to see what I am missing or what I did wrong. I also needed help with data validation througout the Assignments. Assignment 2 challenged me with having to code on the server which was very difficult for me and allowed me to get some hands on time with dealing with the server side processing.


5) How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

This assignment I spent quite a bit of time in both html and css to create a login and registration page. However, this was different from Assignemnt #1 because in Assignemnt #1 we needed to create an entire webpage which connected to an invoice. In Assignemnt #2 we incorporated a login and registration page to make the website more realistic in that it now connects users to it and allows users to come back to the page using the same log in username and password. Assignment #2 also had us working on the server for certain aspects including the data validation. Because most of the technical and difficult parts of the assignemnt was done on the server, I felt like I spent about my entire time on the server. 


6) Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging.

In terms of Assignment 2, I spent 25% of the time thinking about how to do something, 50% of the time writing code, including making practice code, testing the code, and redoing the code to try a different pathway, and I spent 25% of the time testing a debugging the code


7) Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

Personally, almost nothing worked very well for me. I had a lot of trouble with creating the login page and the registration page and making the data validation work for these pages. It was mostly difficult bringing the values from the products page to the invoice after the user logs in or registers. It was also difficult starting on my assignment 2 when my assignment 1 barely worked as is. I feel like the assignements could have been cut to only Assignemnt 1 and 2 and not Assignnment 3 because I feel like I learn more when Assignments aren't all crammed into 2 weeks.

8) If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

I would definitely start earlier. I spent a lot of my time watching hte recordings from the past lectures and I was not able to get through all of the lectures necessary to complete the assignment. Like many of my other assignemnts, I should not have procrastinated, and if I were to have more time or have a redo on this semester, I will do all of my assignments much earlier than I did this time around.
