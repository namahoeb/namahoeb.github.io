Aloha everyone!

I have minimal experience with coding and took this ITM class with the intentions of learning more. These WOD truly force you to challenge yourself to understand what you are coding and how the appearance of the content changes as you change you code more and more. Starting with BrowserHistory1, this took me 3 tries. During the first try, I didn't even bother to set the time or record because I wanted to use the extra time to play with the coding to see what the different features do. Although I read about HTML coding from the readings prior to doing the WOD, it is much different when you are actually putting the code in and being able to visually see the changes. For my second try, I understood the code, but it took me about 23 minutes and I was not satisfied with my time. I completed it, but typed through the content slower to ensure I did not make any mistakes. For my third attempt, I recorded and completed it in 16 minutes. This time I had all of the sperate pages to copy and paste the links open for easy access so I could finish in a timely manner.

For WOD BrowserHistory2, I again, used the strategy where I did not bother to set a time or a recording. By doing this, I noticed it allows me flexibilty and less stress to complete it quickly. Doing so also gives me the opportunity to play with the code and understand it to my best ability. This helps me get a better grasp of the material. Then for my second try, I felt confident enough to record and set a timer to complete this WOD. I finished in about 5 minutes because I really took the time during the first attempt to understand my code.

Finally, for the WOD BrowserHistory3, I used the same strategy. For the first try, I attempted to do the coding on my own and did research. I still had difficulties, so I used the video to assist with completing my first attempt. For my second attempt, I followed along with the video, but did not record it as I used this as extra practice in completing the assignment. I did, however, set a timer during this second attempt to see how long it would take me while also pausing the video every so often to try to do the next step by myself. I was able to complete it within the AD time, so I felt more confident in doing a final attmept. For my third attempt I completed this on my own and within the RX time.

My adivce is to not worry about the timing and recording when it is your first time seeing the WOD. I believe that you should only record after you have spent some time getting familiar with the material and feeling confident while doing so. By doing this, you don't worry about being fast and finsihing it as soon as possible, but instead you can use a larger time gap to understand it better so that the recording will be quick and easy and within the AD or RX times. Don't be afraid to try to record again. No one is perfect and this may (will definitely) take multiple tries, especially if you are just starting off. Best of luck!
