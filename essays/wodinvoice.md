Aloha Everyone!

Doing this WOD, was personally my favorite amongst the other past WOD's. This one was also a bit more challenging for me. I ran into a few slip ups, but managed to fix them towards the end and completed the WOD within the Av time. In this WOD we used JavaScript and HTML to create a table with the product purchases in the table to create an invoice. In the Invoice1 WOD, https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html , we created an invoice.

This WOD was both easier and difficult for me, depending on the aspect. Implementing JavaScript, assigning values to variables, using document.write, and creating comments were all rather simple. The most difficult part is not making a mistake. For me, I made a mistake in the sub-total portion. I assigned the value:

    var salestax_price = subtotal_price + salestax_price

The output turned out as NaN because I assigned the incorrect value in the beginning and affect the outcome at the end. When I figured out, I made the adjument and the variable looked like this:

    var salestax_price = subtotal_price + tax_rate

It is important to catch the mistakes in the beginning before moving on or else it can be very difficult in the end to go back up into your code to look for the mistake if checking for code manually. After the adjustment, the invoice looked correct.

Another issue I had was the backslash. I am so used to seeing the normal slash (/) when typing and reading, however, for code you need to use the back slash (\) in order to make the coding do what you want it to do. This was naother issue I experienced, luckily, I was able to catch it before duplicating the template 5 times because I saved and ran the code first.

Similar to the previous WODs, I started by reading the directions and using my first try to go through the document slowly with the video, screen recording, or the timer. This allows me to pick through it slowly and truly understand what is happening on each line and gives me the time to fix mistakes without the pressure of finishing before the timer runs out. This has proven effective for me the past few times for achieving a time of Av or Rx. Then, after attempting it on my own, I watch the video, then practice coding on my own page with the video showing the steps. After the two attempts, I felt a bit more confident and decided to record my WOD. I did experience a few slip ups, but after practicing a few times I had a few extra minutes to spare since I was confident enough to do a portion of the coding quickly and easily.

Reading the articles and reading and also listening and taking notes on the lecture screencasts allow me to get through the WOD easier after getting familiar with the coding and assignments. Something I will try to do next time is do another practice run on my own without watching the video for a 3rd attempt. After I worked with the video then decided to do it on my own, I ran into a few brain-farts and had to re-read the directiosn and my code multiple time to see where I went wrong.

I hope my method of WOD's can help you in your future WOD's! Good luck!
